# Game Theory Project

## Introduction
This project explores two game theory scenarios: "The Resource Allocation Challenge" and "Monopoly vs. Competition". It demonstrates the application of game theory concepts to analyze strategic decision-making in resource management and market competition.

## Project Overview

### **The Resource Allocation Challenge**
- This game simulates the dynamics of resource allocation, where participants take on the roles of Water Manager and Water Users.
- The objective is to meet water needs at the lowest cost, highlighting the strategic considerations involved in resource distribution.
- The project includes a detailed analysis of the best response strategies for each player, leading to the identification of the Nash Equilibrium.
- The implementation is provided in a Google Colab notebook, allowing for interactive exploration and experimentation.

### **Monopoly vs. Competition**
- This game explores the dynamics between a monopolist (Firm B) and a potential new entrant (Firm A) in a market.
- The game examines the strategies available to both firms, such as accommodating the new entrant or engaging in a price war.
- The project provides a game representation, analyzes the best responses of the players, and identifies the Nash Equilibrium.
- The implementation is also available in a Google Colab notebook for further investigation.

## Getting Started
1. Access the Google Colab notebooks for each game scenario:
   - [The Resource Allocation Challenge](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GBRKPaZ2uXS3UG48mtMpiogUOEt0M3ug?usp=sharing)
   - [Monopoly vs. Competition](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QOobYVGi9p_KROZ_8FE5hXsIzMtX8u8O?usp=sharing)
2. Run the notebooks to explore the game theory scenarios and their analyses.
3. Customize the parameters and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of game theory concepts.
